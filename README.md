# Movielens-Case-Study
## Project Description
   * Performed the analysis using the Exploratory Data Analysis technique. Found features affecting the ratings of any particular movie and built a model to predict the movie ratings.
   
## Process
Analysis tasks performed:
   * Combined all the datasets to create a Master data
   * Explored the datasets using visual representations (graphs and tables), also includes the comments on the following:
   
       * User Age Distribution
       * User rating of the movie “Toy Story”
       * Top 25 movies by viewership rating
       * Find the ratings for all the movies reviewed by for a particular user of user id = 2696
        
   * Feature Engineering:
       * Found out all the unique genres
       * Created a separate column for each genre category with a one-hot encoding ( 1 and 0) whether or not the movie belongs to that genre
       * Determined the features affecting the ratings of any particular movie
       * Developed a Linear Regression model to predict the movie ratings
